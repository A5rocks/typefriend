<!--## typefriend

Python's type hints are friendly!

```sh
pip install typefriend
```

#### Priorities

1. friendliness
2. performance

Note that performance is second. Type checkers can be amazingly quick; just decrease the amount of (super helpful!) work they do!

I'm not going to write much more for now because I don't know if this will ever even leave my hard drive.-->

work in progress! for now, all rights reserved. sorry.
